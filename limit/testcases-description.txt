00 - f(x) = y at three points and error bounds do not extend past local extrema
01 - f(x) = y at three points but error bounds extend past one local extremum
02 - f(x) = y at one point and there are no local extrema (and no flat points whatsoever)
03 - f(x) = y at one point and there are no local extrema (but there is a flat point)
04 - f(x) = y at one point and there are local extrema but error bounds do not include them
05 - f(x) = y at one point and error bounds include one local extremum
06 - f(x) = y at one point and error bounds include both local extrema
